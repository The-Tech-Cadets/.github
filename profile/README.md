👀 You’re probably wondering where to start… we got you! 😎
There are two main things you can work on here to earn a certificate of participation:

🔨 Build an original project by yourself or with a team to showcase at the end of every project session.
OR
📚 Work through online curriculums to build new skills and create mini-projects for your portfolio.

✅ Start by introducing yourself in ⁠#👋→introductions  then move on to ⁠#✍→project-ideas to find any project teams you’d like to join. Feel free to post a project you’re planning to work on to recruit new project team members. 

🤗 If you don’t want to work on team projects, check out Online Curriculum channels like ⁠#🖌→odin-project , ⁠#🏕→freecodecamp , and ⁠#💻→100-days-of-swift . 

Don't forget to take a look below for more guidance on project building!
